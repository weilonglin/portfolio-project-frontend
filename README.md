## User stories

- As a user, I would like to signup and make a profile
- As a user, I want to add my dogs to my profile, to find a dog date

- As a user, I want to browse through a feed of other dog profiles, to find the perfect match for my dog

- As a user, I want to ‚Äúlike‚Äù a dog profile, so that the other dog owner gets notified on our intrest

- As a user, I want to know when another user has ‚Äúliked‚Äù my dog‚Äôs profile, so we can chat and possible arrange a walk

- As a user, I want to ‚Äúdislike‚Äù a profile that is in no way a match, by disliking, the app shouldn‚Äôt show me that profile again

- As a user, I want targeted profiles served on the feed, so the best matches show up

- As a user, I want to filter through profiles, to find the best matches.
